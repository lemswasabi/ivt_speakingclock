# IVT_SpeakingClock

To run the speaking clock application, you first need to install the required dependencies in your [virtual environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/):

```sh
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After setting up the dependencies, you can execute the `main.py` programme:

```sh
python main.py
```


## Work contribution
We divided our works fairly. However, since Leminh has a CS background he took a lead role in the development process. Tatsu instead took a lead role in the presentation.

- Leminh  Designed the speaking clock structure and set up github for the collaboration. Wrote a code to make speaking clock works and helped Tatsu out for github usage. 

- Tatsu  Recorded speech and wrote a code to make speaking clock works by following the program structure and github collaboration rules. Structurized presentaton and made slides.
