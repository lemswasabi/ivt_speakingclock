# IVT_SpeakingClock

This repository contains our speaking clock for assignment 3 of the Intro to Voice Tech course.

## Installation guide

- This repository was tested with Python 3.9.7 on Mac and Linux environments.

To run the speaking clock application, make sure that you have [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) installed on your machine.

Then you need to install the required dependencies in a [virtual environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/):

```sh
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you are using Mac, you need the following package before running our program:

```sh
python -m pip install PyObjC
```

After setting up the dependencies, you can execute the `main.py` programme:

```sh
python main.py
```

## Work contribution
We divided our works fairly. However, since Leminh has a CS background he took the lead role in the development process. Tatsu instead took the lead role in the presentation.

- Leminh: Designed the speaking clock structure and set up the github repository for the collaboration. Wrote the code to make sure our speaking clock works and helped Tatsu out collaborating through version control. Further, Leminh was responsible for editing the final video presentation.

- Tatsu: Recorded speech and implemented the code for the speaking clock by following the program structure and github collaboration rules. Additionally, Tatsu worked on the structure of the presentation and slides.
